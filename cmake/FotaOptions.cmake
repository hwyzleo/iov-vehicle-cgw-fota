# cmake/FotaOptions.cmake - CGW-FOTA-DSN-CR-008 §12
#
# Composable build options for CGW-FOTA.
#
# Hard constraints (CR-008 §12.2/§12.3/§12.6):
#   * Does NOT set compiler, sysroot, target triple or host absolute paths.
#   * Coverage/sanitizer are dev/CI-only and MUST NOT change release ABI or
#     leak into install rules / exported interfaces.
#   * Warnings are composable; never alter release ABI.

option(FOTA_ENABLE_COVERAGE "Enable code coverage instrumentation (dev/CI only)" OFF)
option(FOTA_ENABLE_SANITIZER "Enable address/undefined-behavior sanitizer (dev/CI only)" OFF)

# CGW-FOTA-DSN-CR-009 §构建与运行隔离：Mock/测试桩仅允许测试/联调 profile。
# 量产 preset 必须为 OFF；CI 扫描量产链接产物和配置。运行时不允许
# "真实实现失败后自动回退 Mock"。
option(FOTA_ENABLE_TEST_DOUBLES "Enable Mock/test-double components (NON_PRODUCTION)" OFF)

# Coverage and sanitizer are non-release concerns. Refuse them in Release
# builds to guarantee release ABI stability (CR-008 §12.3 "warning、sanitizer、
# coverage 为可组合选项；不得改变 release ABI").
